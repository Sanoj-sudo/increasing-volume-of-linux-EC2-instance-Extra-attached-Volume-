If you want to increase your EBS Extra attach Volume size follow the below command for Linux.

Step 1: First check the mounted volume which are present so that we can increase the volume accordingly.
 df -h 
 
Step 2: By following below command you can see all the block device on the linux machine.
lsblk

Step 3: Now check is there is file system or not on drive that you want to grow if no file system present so you need to format the drive
        Type below command to check the filesystem.
file -s /dev/xvdf

Note:  If output is :-  /dev/xvdf: data

If you got above output it means there is no file system present on the drive you need to format it as per your file system need.
To format the drive type below command:

mkfs -t xfs /dev/xvdf

Note: Here "xvdf" is your attached dive name


If your disk is alredy formated so go for below command or you have formated you can also go for below command 

file -s /dev/xvdf

Step 4:Now we have to mount the the drive for that we need to create a directory in which we mount the drive.
mkdir aws

Step 5: to mount type below comamnd
mount /dev/xvdf aws

Note: here aws is my directory name that i have created in case your it could be your directory name in which you 
want to mount the drive.

Step 6: Now check the drive is mounted or not type below command
df -h 

Step 7: For Parmanenet mount you have to make entry of your mounted volume in fstab.

vi /etc/fstab

after running above command you have to make entry as below entry 


/dev/xvdf       /home/ec2-user/aws      ext4   defaults    0 0


Note: 

Here "/dev/xvdf   is the your device drive 

/home/ec2-user/aws  is your mounted path

ext4  is the file system name 

and some defaults paratmetr is "defaults   0 0"


Another way to mount drive is :

sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf 
mkdir aws
sudo mount /dev/xvdf  aws
nano /etc/fstab

now put your entry as above in line number 46 i have mentioned.
